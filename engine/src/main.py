"""
Defines the main LangGraph engine for LaserFocus.

This module orchestrates the agent's interaction with tools and manages the
application state, particularly for UI canvas updates. It highlights a key
design pattern: the separation of concerns between tool definition/execution
and state mutation.

**Division of Responsibilities for Canvas Updates:**

The interaction between `engine/src/tools/canvas.py`, this `main.py` graph,
and `engine/src/nodes/updateCanvas.py` (specifically `process_canvas_logic`)
is crucial for robust and deterministic UI updates:

1.  **`engine/src/tools/canvas.py` (Canvas Tools):**
    *   **Defines Agent Interface & Input Validation:** These tools (`add_component_to_canvas`,
      `update_canvas`, `clear_canvas`) define the contract for the agent (LLM).
      They specify tool names, descriptions, and argument schemas (often using
      Pydantic models like `AddComponentArgs`, `ComponentInput`). This layer
      performs initial validation of the agent's inputs. For example,
      Pydantic models within the tools handle `props` parsing (e.g., JSON string
      to dict) before data reaches `process_canvas_logic`.
    *   **Data Transformation & Structuring:** Tools take validated agent input and
      transform it into a standardized output format expected by
      `process_canvas_logic`.
      - `update_canvas_tool` returns: `{"canvas": {"components": [...]}}`
      - `add_component_to_canvas_tool` returns: `{"canvas": {"component": {...}}}`
      - `clear_canvas_tool` returns: `{"canvas": "clear"}`
      This consistency simplifies `process_canvas_logic`.
    *   **Encapsulation of Tool-Specific Pre-computation:** While current tools
      are simple, any complex, tool-specific logic or pre-computation (e.g.,
      checking a component registry) would reside here.
    *   **Adherence to Tool Abstraction:** These are standard LangChain/LangGraph
      tools â€“ functions that take input and produce output.

2.  **`engine/src/main.py` (This File - Graph Orchestration):**
    *   **Agent (`generate_action` node):** Decides *what* to do (e.g., "add a
      calendar to the sidebar") and which tool to call with what arguments.
    *   **`ToolNode` (the 'tools_executor' node in the graph):** Executes the chosen
      canvas tool. The tool's output (the "request for change") is added to
      the state as a `ToolMessage`.
    *   **Conditional Routing (`should_run_canvas_processor`):** Directs the flow.
      If a canvas tool was called, the state (now including the `ToolMessage`
      from the canvas tool) is passed to the `canvas_processor` node.
      Otherwise (e.g., `get_weather`), the flow might bypass canvas processing
      and return to the agent.

3.  **`engine/src/nodes/updateCanvas.py` (`process_canvas_logic` function, run by `canvas_processor` node):**
    *   **Deterministic State Mutation:** This function takes the "request for change"
      (extracted from the `ToolMessage` and agent's original call details within
      the `EngineState`) and the current canvas state. It then performs the
      actual, definitive, and deterministic update to `EngineState.canvas`.
      It knows how to interpret the outputs of `add_component_to_canvas_tool`,
      `update_canvas_tool`, and `clear_canvas_tool` to correctly modify the
      `canvas` field in the `EngineState`.

**In essence:**
The tools in `engine/src/tools/canvas.py` prepare and standardize the agent's *intent* for a canvas change. The graph in `main.py` routes this intent. Finally, `process_canvas_logic` in `engine/src/nodes/updateCanvas.py` *applies* that intent to the actual application state. This separation ensures clarity, testability, and robust state management.
