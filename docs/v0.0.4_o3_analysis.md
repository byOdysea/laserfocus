# LaserFocus v0.0.4 ‚Äì Architectural Analysis (o3)

> Generated by o3 after a deep-dive into the **src/** tree and runtime entry-points (May 2025)

---

## 1. Product Summary

LaserFocus is an Electron desktop application that embeds a LangGraph-based autonomous agent (‚ÄúAthena‚Äù) and a **Canvas Engine** capable of inspecting and manipulating the user‚Äôs desktop windows.  Additional capabilities are pulled in at runtime over the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, turning LaserFocus into a local orchestrator that can route tasks to:

* native canvas tools (open/move/close windows, enumerate desktop state)
* remote MCP-hosted tools, prompts and resources
* multiple LLM back-ends (OpenAI, Google, Ollama, etc.) chosen and hot-switched via configuration

A **UI discovery service** scans `src/ui/**` for renderer apps (Notes, Reminders, Settings, AthenaWidget ‚Ä¶) and spawns them as independent `BrowserWindow`s registered in a window registry.  Configuration is stored under `~/.laserfocus/config.json`; API keys are kept separately by an `apiKeyManager` to avoid disk leakage.

## 2. Responsibility Map (‚öôÔ∏è high-level)

* **src/main.ts** ‚Äì Electron bootstrap, initialises config ‚Üí keys ‚Üí agent ‚Üí UI discovery.
* **core/agent** ‚Äì `AthenaAgent` (‚âà 950 LOC) orchestrates LangGraph workflow, tool registry, provider reload.
* **core/canvas** ‚Äì `CanvasEngine` + adapters; exposes structured tools for agents.
* **integrations/llm** ‚Äì provider factory/validation for OpenAI, Google, Ollama, etc.
* **integrations/mcp** ‚Äì `MCPManager` (‚âà 1 000 LOC) maintains connections to multiple MCP servers over stdio, SSE, StreamableHTTP, Docker, OAuth 2.1.
* **infrastructure/config** ‚Äì schema-validated configuration manager + api-key manager + logger.
* **platform/** ‚Äì UI discovery, IPC bridge, window registry.
* **ui/** ‚Äì Vite/React renderer apps and shared widgets.

## 3. Value Delivered by v0.0.4 (‚úÖ)

1. **Provider-agnostic agent** ‚Äì Athena can hot-switch between LLM back-ends without restart.
2. **Validated config layer** ‚Äì Single schema with dev/prod fall-backs; API keys migrated out of config file.
3. **Rich MCP support** ‚Äì StreamableHTTP, OAuth 2.1, Docker executor, fine-grained tool/resource/prompt filters.
4. **UI hot-reload & discovery** ‚Äì No manual window wiring; greatly improved DX.
5. **Performance guards** ‚Äì Canvas state memoisation, debounced MCP event handling.
6. **Dependency-injection hooks** ‚Äì Easier unit testing (agent, MCP manager, transports).

## 4. Complexity & Risk Introduced (‚ö†Ô∏è)

| Area | Observation | Risk |
|------|-------------|------|
| **Mega-classes** | `athena-agent.ts` (950 LOC) & `mcp-manager.ts` (1 000 LOC) bundle factories, state machines, UI callbacks. | Hard to reason about; discourages contribution; coupled changes.
| **Event-bus sprawl** | Node EventEmitter, Electron IPC, config `onChange`, custom callbacks ‚áí manual `setMaxListeners(50)`. | Memory leak potential; debugging cross-bus flows is tedious.
| **Speculative features** | Docker executor, OAuth 2.1, HTTP transport placeholders not surfaced in UI. | YAGNI until confirmed need; increases maintenance burden.
| **Duplicated validation logic** | Provider & transport validation live in multiple places. | Divergence over time; wasted LOC.
| **Missing automated tests** | None of the new critical paths have unit or integration tests. | Regressions likely; onboarding friction.
| **Deep call chain** | renderer ‚Üí ipc ‚Üí agentBridge ‚Üí Athena ‚Üí LangGraph ‚Üí CanvasEngine. | Logging present but no tracing context; diagnosing failures takes effort.

## 5. Cost‚ÄìBenefit Snapshot

```
Benefit gained           ‚âà 60 % of new LOC
Incidental complexity    ‚âà 40 % of new LOC
```

The strategic bets (multi-provider agent, MCP extensibility, developer UX) justify their upkeep.  The speculative transports and oversized classes do not ‚Äì they are prime candidates for refactor or delayed integration.

## 6. Recommendations (üîß next steps)

1. **Refactor mega-classes**
   * Break `AthenaAgent` into: `ProviderLifecycle`, `WorkflowOrchestrator`, `ToolRegistry`, `ConfigWatcher`.
   * Split `MCPManager` into: `TransportFactory`, `ConnectionPool`, `ComponentFilter`.
2. **Unify event channels**
   * Adopt a single typed EventEmitter/RxJS bus; remove manual listener cap.
3. **Test harness**
   * Add integration tests:
     1. Config change ‚Üí agent re-initialises & tool hash stable.
     2. MCP server flap ‚Üí tools refresh without leaks.
     3. Renderer ‚Üî agent IPC round-trip.
4. **Feature gating**
   * Guard Docker executor & OAuth 2.1 behind flags until the UI exposes them.
5. **Remove duplication**
   * Centralise provider & transport validation utilities; reference them instead of duplicating.
6. **Documentation & diagrams**
   * Add a Mermaid diagram of the runtime data-flow in `docs/architecture.md` to flatten the onboarding curve.
7. **Performance roadmap**
   * Capture metrics (LLM latency, window op latency, memory) and feed them into adaptive throttling instead of fixed caches.

## 7. Suggested Milestones

| Quarter | Deliverable |
|---------|-------------|
| **Q2-25** | Refactor mega-classes; bring unit tests to ‚â•70 % coverage of core/agent & integrations/mcp.
| **Q3-25** | Consolidate event system; ship UI toggles for OAuth 2.1 & Docker transports.
| **Q4-25** | Introduce performance telemetry, adaptive scheduling & CI/CD pipeline with regression tests.

## 8. Verdict

LaserFocus's recent expansion is directionally correct: it turns the app into an extensible **local AI orchestrator**.  The architecture, however, is creaking under the weight of newly added responsibilities.  Addressing the outlined refactors and instituting automated tests will curb the complexity tax while preserving the strategic capabilities introduced in v0.0.4.
